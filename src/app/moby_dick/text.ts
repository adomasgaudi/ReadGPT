    text: `Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely-
  having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest
  me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part
  of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating
  the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;
  whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find
  myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up
  the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get
  such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to
  prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically
  knocking people’s hats off- then, I account it high time to get to sea as
  soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a
  philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take
  to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost
  all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same
  feelings towards the ocean with me.
  There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by
  wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs- commerce surrounds it with her
  surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme
  downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and
  cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land.
  Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
  Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from
  Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall,
  northward. What do you see?- Posted like silent sentinels all around the
  town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean
  reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-
  heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high
  aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But
  these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster- tied to
  counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the
  green fields gone? What do they here?
  But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
  seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the
  extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
  warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as
  they possibly can without falling And there they stand- miles of them-
  leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets avenues-
  north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the
  magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract
  them thither?`,

    text: `Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the
most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries- stand
that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you
to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in
the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to
be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows,
meditation and water are wedded for ever. 
But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,
quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of
the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees,each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and
here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder
cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy
way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side
blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree
shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were
vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before
him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you
wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies- what is the one charm wanting?-
Water- there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of
sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor
poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver,
deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest
his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every
robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or
other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did
you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and
your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold
the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own
brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper
the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp
the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and
was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and
oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the
key to it all.`,
