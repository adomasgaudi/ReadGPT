          I've spent my life immersed in YouTube. I'm not the only one, of course, but I've watched a lot more of certain content than others. I always watched in english and most of my consumed content was about physics or some sort of science. And so, after spending a decade immersed in captivating science content for free, the stark contrast of university classes was too hard for me to ignore.

          When in University, to my eye, the lecturers were not presenting the information in an interesting way. It was slow and booring. Fortunately, the classes were recorded. So I skipped them and just went to the library to watch the recordings, often at 2x speed, skipping large parts of awkward unstructured lecturing. Not all classes were like this of course. But some of them were so comicly detached from reality that it made me seriously consider as to the legitimacy ever increasing tuition.

        <p>I remember one professor tried to explain that you cannot find a table already made in the forest, so you have to first find wood and then create a table. He was totaly serious in his explanation.</p>
        <H3>The climax</H3>
        <p>Watching those lectures on my laptop at night in the library I decided that I would rather watch something that has a million views on YouTube for free, than this.</p>
        <p>
          There were other reasons for me to leave Loughborough, but the biggest was that I would take on 36 thousand pounds of debt for something that I though was worse than a free alternative.

          So I left. I left university, and decided to only pursue education that is free or very low-cost. As a result, I've been learning from online courses, blogs, documentations, and programming practice websites such as CodeWars. It hasn't been perfect, and sometimes I wish there was a structured syllabus with a diploma at the end, but I am searching for a solution to a problem that a lot of young people have. And that does not feel like a waste of my time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope my path becomes more accepted and more mainstream in the future. I think my most meaningful progress stems from the projects that I've done, some of which I've listed here in this portfolio.
